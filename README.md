# Insert_files_to_sql
Consolidating all files in the path and loading into particular table in SQL Database

The code will get input all the details such as folder path, sheet name, Driver name, Database and table name from the user
Then, it will search for .xlsx or .csv or .xlsb files in the folder and consolidate them into one dataframe
with the database and table name, it will load all the data into SQL


Hope this code will help new learners of Python and SQL

Please feel free to point out mistakes in the code if any
